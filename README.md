# ☕ Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in Java

Welcome to my **Data Structures and Algorithms** repository, featuring clean and well-structured implementations in **Java**.

> 📘 Built as part of my journey to master DSA using Java — useful for logic building, interview prep, academic use, and concept revision.
